# Petraton commences Project Ouriel Geological Survey

Petraton has commenced geological mapping of the SW Nigeria Schist Belt to identify Lithium mineralization potential in Oyo State, SW Nigeria.



## H**ighlights**

A systematic geological mapping has commenced in earnest over the area surrounding Petraton licenses to identify the rock types and delineate the lithological relationships within the area. 

Geologic samples taken over the area will be sent to the lab for further petrographic (thin section), mineralogical and geochemical analyses to reveal mineralization type, quantity, and distribution.

These will be integrated into the geological maps to define targets that will be followed up with detailed prospect mapping and definition of anomalous areas.
